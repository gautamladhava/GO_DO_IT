                    <p class="big-text"> Working for Go Do It is different. We believe in fixed-term contracts with
                        clear objectives and
                        rewards.</p>
                    <p class="big-text">
                        We are a real “suitable for graduates” employer looking for fresh minds and talent that we can
                        help
                        develop and grow. We believe in constant renovation with all staff, including our founders,
                        having a
                        limited term in office – providing opportunity for growth and development.
                    </p>
                    <p class="big-text">
                        If this sounds like the kind of company you’d like to work for, then impress us. Send us a CV,
                        your
                        education transcript and a video explaining why we should give you a shot.

                            <p>
                                Our policy regarding work location is simple. We believe strongly in face-to-face
                                collaboration, especially when running multi-disciplinary workshops with our customers.
                                We also believe that in order to mentor staff to help them develop and grow,
                                face-to-face contact is vital.</p>
                            <p>
                                So 100% remote working is not an option.</p>
                            <p>
                                When it needs to happen in the office, we go to the office. When it can be done
                                remotely, we do it remotely. If this doesn’t speak to you, then we aren’t for you.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We pay a fixed monthly fee for the term of your contract. We pay your superannuation
                                contribution to the fund of your choice. We provide twenty-five days paid vacation. We
                                offer every employee that successfully completes their probation period a share in the
                                profits of the company that are accrued during the term of their employment.</p>
                            <p>
                                We provide mentoring in a way that few companies do, with the opportunity to learn not
                                only how to better do the job you are hired for, but also how to run a company, with the
                                opportunity to look at finance, hr, sales & marketing, contracts & legal in order to get
                                a true understanding of what makes the company tick, how we make our money and what your
                                contribution means.

                            <p>

                                Our policy regarding work hours is also simple. We pay a fixed monthly amount for
                                labour.</p>
                            <p>
                                We don’t expect people to work overtime, but we do expect our staff to be committed to
                                deliver on client promises, which may sometimes lead to having to work harder and longer
                                than the norm, or work to a fixed schedule while on a client project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That said we also understand life – so flexibility with regards to working hours is also
                                the norm for us.
                            </p>
